**Pass App**

This is my final project for the CS50 course by Harvard University. I love
the idea of a password manager that is well built and secure and I
started to code one. I tried to write as much code as possible from
scratch not knowing a lot about authentication or AES encryption. But
with small steps and a steep learning curve, I managed to create
something that is functional.</br></br>
In the back end, I used Flask, and with some helper functions from
CS50, I managed to tie together all the routes necessary to have a
functional back end and database.</br></br>
For the front end, I tried as much as possible to find ways to write pure
CSS and JavaScript, not relying on any framework because I wanted to
improve my skills. After learning BEM(Block Element Modifier) and
SASS(Scss) I found myself in the position to create my own CSS
framework.</br></br>
Now you can easily create an account, log in and manage your
passwords on my app. This of course not ready for production in any
way but I am very happy about how much one person can achieve with
a few months of studying.</br></br>
