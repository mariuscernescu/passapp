**Pass App**

PassApp is a simple password manager app I originally developed for my CS50 final project. The main goal of this app is to store all your passwords for every online service you use and help you generate more secure passwords in case you want to update them.

**Project description**

When you access the app, you will land on a welcome page where you need to choose either to create a new account or login with an existing one. When you signup as a new user, you need to provide a username and password. You will be notified if your username is already taken or if your password is not strong enough. 

Once your account has been created, you will need need to log in. On the main page, you will see a button for adding new entries and a search bar for searching through all your entries (you will not have any yet as a new user). 

When you add a new entry, you will need to fill in the following fields: website name, link, username, and password. During this step, you can choose to update your password by generating a new and more secure one, or you can just add your current password. After an entry is recorded in the app, you can edit it or delete it. Please note, that for security reasons, for any change you want to make - you will need to enter your PassApp password first. 

All entries are automatically ordered alphabetically, but you can also easily find one by using the search function.
